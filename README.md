# if you face any issue regarding cors then use extension on your browser. if the task was done in backend then there would be no issue.

## Note : in the front end i faced cors issue and couldn't solve it since i didn't use backend in this task . To get the array please use browser console . i tried to show it in the frontend.SO please use browser extension to handle cors issue.
